      <SectionHeading>About Me</SectionHeading>
      <p className="mb-3">
        Before becoming frontend engineer, my first job was a QA engineer.
        Because of intern working experience, it makes me interest in frontend development, so currently I focus on web development.
        My favorite part of programming is the problem-solving aspect.
        I love the feeling of finally figuring out a solution to a problem.<br />
        My core tech stack is <span className="relative font-medium inline-block highlight">React, NextJS, Vue, NuxtJS and TypeScript</span>.
        I am also familiar with <span className="font-medium">Golang and PostgreSQL.</span>
      </p>
      <p className="mb-3">
        I actively seek out new technologies and stay up-to-date on industry trends and advancements.
        Currently, I'm moving towards the goal of becoming a full-stack engineer, and looking for a full-time position as a software developer.</p>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding, I enjoy <span className="font-medium">watching movies</span> and <span className="font-medium">hiphop dancing</span> even have participated in dance performances on stage.
        I am like a curious child, open my mind to embrace new things, <span className="block font-medium">Peace and Love. ‚úåÔ∏è üíõ</span>
